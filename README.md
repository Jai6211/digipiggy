## 1. Website Conceptualization  

### *Mission Statement*  
The goal of *DigiPiggy* is to create a modern platform that gives people a simple and enjoyable way to save money online, just like saving coins in a piggy bank at home.  

Unlike most financial applications that focus heavily on automation or complex investment strategies, DigiPiggy emphasizes personal choice, control, and habit-building. Users are not forced into automatic deductions but can decide exactly when and how much they want to save, even if it’s just a dollar. This system combines the comfort of tradition with the convenience and safety of digital banking.
