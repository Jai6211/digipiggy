## 1. Website Conceptualization  

### *Mission Statement*  
The purpose of DigiPiggy is to bring back the idea of a piggy bank, but in a modern and digital way. Saving money is often seen as something stressful or complicated, especially with all the apps that focus on investments, budgets, and automatic systems. DigiPiggy is different because it makes saving feel simple, personal, and even fun.

With DigiPiggy, people can choose how and when they want to save. Just like dropping coins into a piggy bank at home, users can add money whenever they want—even if it’s just a dollar. There are no rules forcing them to set up automatic transfers or commit to big amounts. Instead, it gives them the freedom to save at their own pace, which helps build better habits over time.

The platform combines the comfort of a traditional saving method with the benefits of digital banking. It’s safe, easy to use, and always accessible. DigiPiggy is not about making finance complicated—it’s about reminding people that saving doesn’t have to be stressful.

In the end, DigiPiggy’s goal is to encourage everyone, especially beginners, to save money in small, simple steps. By keeping it fun and flexible, it makes the whole process of saving feel more like a personal achievement than a chore.
