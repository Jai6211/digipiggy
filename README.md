1. Website Conceptualization

Mission Statement
The goal of DigiPiggy is to create a modern platform that gives people a simple and enjoyable way to save money online, just like they save coins in a piggy bank at home. Instead of putting spare cash into a physical jar, users will be able to connect their bank account and move small amounts of money into DigiPiggy whenever they want. This system combines the comfort and habit of traditional saving with the convenience and safety of digital banking.

Unlike most financial applications that focus heavily on automation or complex investment strategies, DigiPiggy emphasizes personal choice and habit-building. Users are not forced into automatic deductions but can decide exactly when and how much they want to save, even if it is as little as one dollar. By encouraging voluntary contributions, DigiPiggy recreates the emotional satisfaction of dropping coins into a piggy bank while still providing the benefits of digital tracking, security, and accessibility.

The platform aims to serve students, families, and general users who often struggle to build consistent savings habits. With features like goal-based jars, visual piggy banks, and reminders, DigiPiggy not only helps people save money but also motivates them to enjoy the process of saving.

2. Target Users

a) Students and Young Adults
Demographics: Ages 18–30, mostly college students or those starting their first jobs. They are frequent smartphone users, rely on online banking, and often look for simple apps to manage daily expenses.
Needs: Students and young adults typically have limited income and may find it difficult to set aside large sums. They need a platform that allows small, flexible savings without pressure. They also value apps that are fun and engaging rather than overly formal.
Support: DigiPiggy provides the option to save even one or two dollars whenever they like, making it easy to begin building a savings habit. The gamified design, including progress bars and piggy bank visuals, helps keep them motivated to continue.

b) Families and Parents
Demographics: Adults aged 25–50 who manage household budgets and are often responsible for financial planning. Many want to encourage their children to understand the value of money.
Needs: Families require tools to save together for shared goals such as vacations, home improvements, or education funds. They also want to demonstrate the importance of savings to their children.
Support: DigiPiggy offers family accounts where multiple members can contribute. Parents can create digital piggy banks for their children, set specific goals, and show progress over time. This makes saving a collective and educational activity.

c) General Everyday Users
Demographics: Adults between the ages of 18 and 60 with different income levels and lifestyles. Many have busy routines and do not have time to use complicated financial applications.
Needs: These users want a quick, reliable, and safe way to put aside money without complicated features or investment risks. They are looking for a straightforward savings tool that is easy to understand.
Support: DigiPiggy allows everyday users to open a simple digital piggy bank, deposit money at their own pace, and monitor progress with clear visuals. Notifications and reminders make sure they do not forget to save, even during busy weeks.

3. Main Functionalities

User Registration and Login
Users create secure accounts and sign in with either a password or a one-time code.

Bank Account Linking
Users connect their bank accounts safely to enable deposits and withdrawals.

Manual Savings Deposit
Users decide exactly when and how much money to move into DigiPiggy. This can be as little as one dollar.

Digital Piggy Bank Balance View
A friendly interface shows savings growing over time, similar to watching a piggy bank fill up.

Goal Setting
Users can set specific goals such as buying a new phone, planning a trip, or building an emergency fund.

Progress Tracking
Graphs and progress bars help users see how close they are to reaching their goals.

Notifications and Reminders
Alerts remind users to save regularly and encourage them when goals are close to completion.

Secure Transactions
All financial transfers use encryption and industry-standard security measures.

Unique Points
Most apps like Acorns and Chime use automatic saving methods such as rounding up purchases. While useful, these methods can feel impersonal. DigiPiggy is unique because it focuses on voluntary, manual savings that give users control and a sense of accomplishment. The use of visual piggy banks, gamification, and family savings accounts makes it stand out from traditional banking applications.

4. Preliminary Development Plan

Phase 1: Research and Analysis
The team will research how different user groups save money today. Surveys and interviews will be conducted with students and families to understand their habits. Competitors such as Chime, Acorns, and Paytm Piggybank will be studied to find features they lack, particularly in the area of manual savings and gamification.

Phase 2: Design
DigiPiggy will use a simple and colorful mobile-first design since most users will access it on their phones. The interface will include a digital piggy bank that fills up with every deposit, progress bars for goals, and easy navigation. Accessibility considerations such as large text, color-blind friendly palettes, and clear icons will be included.

Phase 3: Development
Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Backend: Node.js with Express
Database: MySQL for storing account details, transactions, and goals
Integration: Secure API services such as Plaid to connect bank accounts

Phase 4: Testing
Unit Testing: Each feature will be tested separately.
User Testing: Students and parents will try the app and give feedback.
Performance Testing: The system will be checked for speed and reliability when used by many people at once.
Security Testing: Strong encryption, two-factor authentication, and penetration testing will be applied.

Phase 5: Launch and Maintenance
The first launch will be a beta release for a small group of users. Based on their feedback, improvements will be made before the public release. Maintenance will include fixing bugs, releasing updates, and adding new features such as challenges and rewards to encourage saving.

5. Collaboration Requirement
Each team member will contribute to the README file and future development.
